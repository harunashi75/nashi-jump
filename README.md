🎮 Nashi Jump – Version 0.6.0 The Void Update

Nashi Jump is a small retro platformer, simple in concept... but always full of challenges. Every jump counts, and the traps are unforgiving. Fortunately, the levels now have checkpoints to make the adventure more accessible while keeping the challenge intense.

📌 Objective

Jump, avoid traps and enemies, collect the 200 coins scattered throughout the levels... and reach the end.

Checkpoints are there to help you progress: each level now has at least one, allowing you to learn and improve without starting from scratch.
